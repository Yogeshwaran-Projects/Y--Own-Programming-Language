# Y++ Programming Language

Y++ is a simple toy programming language built from scratch in C++.  
It includes a **lexer, parser, AST, and execution engine**, making it a great foundation for understanding compiler design.

## Features
✅ Custom syntax similar to C++  
✅ Tokenizer (Lexer) for breaking down code  
✅ Recursive Descent Parser for syntax analysis  
✅ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for program representation  
✅ Execution engine to run Y++ code  

## Installation
To build Y++, you need a C++ compiler (GCC/Clang).  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yplusplus.git
cd yplusplus
g++ -o ypp yplusplus.cpp -std=c++17
